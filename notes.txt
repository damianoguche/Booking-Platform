Industry-Standard Dashboard
1. No Persistent Navigation
Real dashboards almost always have:
Sidebar navigation (left)
Or top + side navigation

Yours has no navigation, so it doesn’t scale when you add:

Users
Payments
Properties
Reports
Settings
Logs

2. Too Many Vertical Sections
You stacked:
Payment stats
Booking stats
User stats
Vertically.

This causes excessive scrolling on real systems.

Industry dashboards usually:
👉 Put KPIs in ONE unified row.

3. No Page Hierarchy
Everything has equal importance visually.
In pro dashboards:

- KPIs first
- Charts second
- Tables third
- System/Admin tools last

Your layout mixes these.

4. No Workspace Feel
Modern admin panels feel like:
 - "This is a control center"

Yours feels more like:
 - "A styled report page"

It should be "control center"

What Industry Standard Looks Like (2026)
Most modern dashboards follow:
